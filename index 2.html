        Argentina national team coach Lionel Scaloni arrived back in Argentina where he spoke about Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala, the World Cup qualifiers and much more.

        Scaloni will announce his list for this month’s World Cup qualifiers in the upcoming week. Several injuries to key players as well as travel restrictions could be a problem as the team go up against Uruguay and Brazil later this month. Having only drawn one match and won the other three, Scaloni’s team are second in qualifying. They host Uruguay on March 26 before traveling to play Brazil on March 30 in two difficult games.
